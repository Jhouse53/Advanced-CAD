## Skate Board

### Description
We made a skateboard first we started by making a sketch for the deck. We also add screw holes into the top which we'll need later. We then made the trucks via making a couple of blocks and then making it nicer from there. We then made the wheels. We then attatched it all together in a parts studio using screws in the holes we made earlier as well as some mate connecters

### Reflection
I dind't think that this assingment was to challeging since we had the instruction. There were still some times where I had to go back and redo sections. Like with the trucks, I had to go back because I forgot to add screw holes into it well we first extruded it. I also learnd a good amount about different tools I don't normally use in Onshape, such as the hole tool. This assignment is an 80% on Rotten Filaments.

## Lego

### Description
We made a actual lego! Not just one as well using configurations we can make the lego into a lot of different sizes and shapes. A first you make multiple different variables and set the length and width to those variables. Then you make your studs and other parts and attach them to your variable so that when you need to change your variable they change with it. You can then make a configuration table and attach all your variables to it and colors as well using that you can then make almost any lego you wnat.

### Reflection
I really like this assingment because I got to use configurations which I have never used before. I think configurations will be very helpfull in the future. The fact that you can have that sort of variability is very usefull. I would give this a 89% on Rotton Filaments.
