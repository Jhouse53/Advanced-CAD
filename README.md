## Skate Board

### Description
We made a skateboard first we started by making a sketch for the deck. We also add screw holes into the top which we'll need later. We then made the trucks via making a couple of blocks and then making it nicer from there. We then made the wheels. We then attatched it all together in a parts studio using screws in the holes we made earlier as well as some mate connecters

### Reflection
I dind't think that this assingment was to challeging since we had the instruction. There were still some times where I had to go back and redo sections. Like with the trucks, I had to go back because I forgot to add screw holes into it well we first extruded it. I also learnd a good amount about different tools I don't normally use in Onshape, such as the hole tool.
